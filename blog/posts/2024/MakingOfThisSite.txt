3:T490,As of 2024 it'll be 4 years since i found the field of computer sicence and around 2 years i've been involved in the field of
cyber security and i play CTF's with team bi0s, and i've come across a lot of CTF writeups from time to time, some of them are
honestly pretty amazing, so i thought about making a blog. Initially i had the idea of making a blog using some static site
generators like hugo, hexo etc but then i thought i do web exploitation in CTF's so learning some web dev frameworks wouldn't
hurt, so i dropped the idea of having to use some other generators and i decided to create one from scratch. When it comes to
web development we have a lot of options, too many!!!, So i finally settled with nextjs because of a few reasons one of them
being that one of my seniors found a security vulnerability in it and advised me to learn the framework, i tried to learn the
framework and couldn't understand anything so i decided to learn the framework in depth and to actually make a website in it
. I endured my first obstacle that being inorder to learn nextjs i had to learn react basics also i decided to use typescript
so i had to learn typescript as well.4:T43a,Now for the final part of the blog that is the blog post itself, for it I used the wellknown MDX library in which you can also
write JSX code as well, so after spending some time setting it up, I wrote my first successfully rendered markdown content after
spending 4 hours fixing my code ;-; and from then on i implemented my custom components to use with MDX this allowed me to use the
full power of MDX and TSX.I used rehypeSlug and highlightjs for getting the cool code highlighting in the blogpost . After setting that up i worked on setting up the index part for blogpost which lists what all sections
are there in the blog post kind of like table of contents for the blog post, this part was tougher than i expected i had to specific
id's for the html generated by MDX from the markdown content so for that i used the MDX plugin rehypeSlug, so now i can jump too
specific part of the blogpost using scroll to text fragment via the anchor in the url. And then i parsed the subheadings from the
markdown and generated an Index part for the website. The code for all that is this0:["NS_-RtQqv3GTIGxGldv2f",[[["",{"children":["blog",{"children":["posts",{"children":["2024",{"children":["MakingOfThisSite",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["blog",{"children":["posts",{"children":["2024",{"children":["MakingOfThisSite",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row h-full  bg-black z-10 border-t-2 border-white","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"__className_7f58b6 flex flex-col px-5 text-white w-1/6 h-full py-3 space-x-5 space-y-5 bg-black z-10 border-r-2 border-white","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl","children":["$","u",null,{"children":"Index"}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-10","children":[["$","li","0",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#intro","children":"Intro"}]]}]}],["$","li","1",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#typescript","children":"Typescript"}]]}]}],["$","li","2",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#react","children":"React"}]]}]}],["$","li","3",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#nextjs","children":"NextJs"}]]}]}],["$","li","4",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#tailwindcss","children":"Tailwindcss"}]]}]}],["$","li","5",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#finally-making-the-site","children":"Finally making the site"}]]}]}],["$","li","6",{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row space-x-3 text-xl","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"--"}],["$","$L2",null,{"className":"text-lg transform transition hover:-translate-y-2 ","href":"#conclusion","children":"Conclusion"}]]}]}]]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"w-full h-full px-5 overflow-x-hidden z-10 bg-black opacity-100","children":[" ",[["$","h1",null,{"id":"the-making-of-this-site","className":"__className_f2448c","style":{"fontSize":"40px"},"children":"The Making Of This Site"}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"id":"description-how-i-made-this-site-going-from-only-knowing-htmlcss-and-js-to-using-frameworks-like-nextjstailwindcss","className":"__className_945a0f","style":{"fontSize":"25px"},"children":"Description: How i made this site, going from only knowing html,css and js to using frameworks like nextjs,tailwindcss...."}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","h3",null,{"id":"tags-frameworksnextjstailwindcss","className":"__className_076904","style":{"fontSize":"20px"},"children":"Tags: frameworks,nextjs,tailwindcss"}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"id":"intro","className":"__className_945a0f","style":{"fontSize":"25px"},"children":"Intro"}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"__className_28c1ba","style":{"fontSize":"18px"},"children":"Alright so this would be my first blog in like ever, so here i goo..."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"__className_28c1ba","style":{"fontSize":"18px"},"children":"$3"}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"id":"typescript","className":"__className_945a0f","style":{"fontSize":"25px"},"children":"Typescript"}],"\n",["$","br",null,{}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"__className_28c1ba","style":{"fontSize":"18px"},"children":"I knew javascript beforehand so i had an upperhand while learning typescript also i had done programming in statically typed\nlanguages before so learning typescript was some what easier for me.
